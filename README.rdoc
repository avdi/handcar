handcar

== DESCRIPTION:

A step up from debugging your Rails apps with with 'puts' and 'raise'.

Handcar emits specially formatted trace lines into your Rails log files, along
with backtrace information.  The 'handcar' executable scrapes your log files for
these trace lines, so you can see whether, and when, they are being hit.  It can
do this in real-time, a la "tail -f".

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* FIXME (list of features or problems)

== SYNOPSIS:

Anywhere in your rails app:

  hc_trace(foo)

On the command line:
  
  $ handcar
  Processing SomeController#some_action (for 127.0.0.1 at 02/25/2009 15:12) [GET]
  _/_ 123 _\_ ** foo
  Completed in 0.95968 (1 reqs/sec) | Rendering: 0.35874 (37%) | DB: 0.27625 (28%) | 200 OK [http://localhost/some_controller/some_action]

  $ handcar -n 123 -t
  _/_ 123 _\_ ** foo
  _/_ 123 _\_ >> file1.rb:123
  _/_ 123 _\_ >> file2.rb:456
  _/_ 123 _\_ >> file3.rb:789

== FUTURE:

* I'd love to add a tiny little web server that would serve up a nicely
  formatted real-time view of traces, with the ability to drill-down and get
  backtrace info.
* A "tag" argument for hc_trace() that would enable better filtering

== REQUIREMENTS:

* The "main" gem
* A reasonably complete *NIX userspace with programs like "grep" and "tail" available.

== INSTALL:

* FIXME (sudo gem install, anything else)
